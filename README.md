# Election_Analysis: A PyPoll Challenge

## 1. Overview of Election Audit:
A Colorado Board of Elections employee tasked me with completing the election audit of a congressional election in that state by writing Python code in such a way  as to calculate the total number of votes cast, to provide the number of votes cast in each of the district's counties and the percentage of the total vote cast in each county, to determine which county had the largest number of votes, to determine the number of votes each candidate received and the percentage of total votes each candidate received, and to determine the candidate who won the election, along with that person's vote count and percentage of the total votes cast.

## 2. Election-Audit Results:
- There were 369,711 votes cast in this congressional election.
- The district is comprised of three counties:
  - Jefferson County had 38,855 votes, which was 10.5% of the total votes cast in the congressional district.
  - Denver County had 306,055 votes, which was 82.8% of the votes.
  - Arapahoe County had 24,801 votes, which was 6.7% of the votes.
- Denver County had the largest number of votes in the congressional district.
- The candidate results were as follows:
  - Charles Casper Stockham received 85,213 votes, or 23.0% of the vote. 
  - Diana DeGette received 272,892 votes, or 73.8% of the vote.
